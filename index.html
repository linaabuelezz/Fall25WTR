                <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Managing Time & Staying Organized</h3>
                <p>
                  One of my priorities at Candescent was learning to manage my tasks effectively and meet deadlines without sacrificing quality. 
                  I adopted a personal tracker where I broke down larger projects into smaller deliverables and prioritized work based on urgency. 
                  Midway through each task, I’d check in with my team to confirm that I was aligned with expectations, which gave me confidence 
                  and saved me from rework later on. Daily progress reports during stand-up not only kept me accountable but also built trust with 
                  my team. By the end of the term, I had consistently met deadlines and had developed a reliable system that I will carry forward 
                  into future roles.

          <!-- Goal 2 -->
          <div class="col-12">

              <div class="card-body">
                <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Becoming a Stronger Problem Solver</h3>
                <p>
                  Debugging was an area I wanted to take to the next level. At the start of the term, I committed to tackling complex bugs by 
                  slowing down and understanding how each component interacted before jumping into a fix. For one particularly challenging bug, 
                  I mapped out the data flow across multiple files, which revealed a hidden dependency that had been overlooked. By approaching 
                  problems methodically and creatively, I was able to deliver a clean, effective fix without adding unnecessary complexity. 
                  This experience taught me the value of patience and systematic thinking, and it gave me more confidence in handling 
                  unfamiliar code.

                <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Improving Written Communication</h3>
                <p>
                  I recognized early on that good technical work can be undercut by poor communication, so I made a conscious effort to seek 
                  feedback and refine how I conveyed my ideas. I began documenting notes from every meeting, asking clarifying questions 
                  whenever I was given a task, and writing clearer pull request descriptions. One turning point was feedback suggesting I add 
                  more context to my PRs, such as the problem, approach, and testing notes. After applying this, my PRs became much easier to 
                  review, and I received positive feedback from teammates. These improvements not only helped my work stand out but also 
                  made collaboration smoother.

                <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Contributing to Team Success</h3>
                <p>
                  Beyond completing my own assignments, I wanted to ensure I was contributing positively to the team dynamic. I made a habit 
                  of checking in with colleagues to see if they needed help and offered to pair-program when someone was stuck. On two 
                  occasions, I directly helped teammates resolve blockers, which not only sped up our collective progress but also exposed me 
                  to new parts of the codebase. These experiences showed me the value of stepping in when others are struggling and 
                  reinforced the importance of building strong, supportive relationships on a team.

                <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Mastering New Tools & Technologies</h3>
                <p>
                  My personal learning goal was to deepen my understanding of Candescent’s tech stack. Each week, I set aside time to study 
                  documentation, READMEs, and wikis for tools I hadn’t used before. I asked teammates questions when I hit roadblocks and 
                  shared useful resources I discovered. Over the course of the term, I documented three new tools and libraries and applied 
                  them directly to my tasks. This not only made me a stronger contributor on my team but also gave me confidence in quickly 
                  picking up new technologies in the future.

        <h2 class="h4">Job Description & Highlights</h2>
        <p>At Candescent, I worked as a UI Software Developer using React to build and improve user-facing components. I integrated APIs, wrote tests, fixed bugs, and refactored legacy forms from Formik to React Hook Form (RHF). A key project I owned was creating functionality to warn secondary users that changes they made to an account would affect all users, which strengthened my skills in component design, testing, and API-driven development.</p>

      <section class="mb-5" id="conclusions">
        <h2 class="h4">Conclusions</h2>
        <p>This work term at Candescent taught me how to deliver reliable code, communicate clearly, and work effectively with a team. I managed my time to meet deadlines, debugged complex issues with confidence, and improved the clarity of my documentation and pull requests. I also grew by helping teammates resolve blockers and by learning new tools that allowed me to own and ship a feature independently.

            If someone were to describe my experience, I’d want them to say: “She developed as a UI Software Developer who not only built strong technical skills in React and API-driven development, but also grew as a collaborator who communicates well and supports her team.”</p>

      <section class="mb-5" id="acknowledgments">
        <h2 class="h4">Acknowledgments</h2>
        <p>There were a lot of people who helped me during my work term, but I'd like to especially acknowledge Mira and Jagruti who were my mentors. Not only were they always ready to connect with me if I was facing any issues, but they also provided me with a lot of documentation and helped me learn a lot to make the most of my first co-op term! I would also like to thank my manager Malathi for making sure everything was as smooth as possible and always allowing me to push myself by giving me the opportunity to work on different epics and complete them on my own. </p>
